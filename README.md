# Documents-Classification-Using-CNN
Proposing the structure of a convolutional neural network, to identify the type of images of documents, the proposed structure of the convolutional neural network includes dividing the image of the document into four main regions and passing those regions to the convolutional neural network as a sequence of single images, and the goal of this methodology is the ability to facilitate the work of The convolutional neural network is able to extract the basic characteristics included in each of the four regions, and then use the GlobalAveragePooling1D layer in order to reach the general characteristics that distinguish the document, and thus the ability of the neural network to easily find the general characteristics that characterize each type of document.
